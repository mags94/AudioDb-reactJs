# AudioDb-reactJs
This is a small and simple artist search application for dektop and laptop using react js.

I have used API to get the search results.

The	app	has	three	screens:
1) The	first	screen	is	a	search	page	where	you	can	search	for	an	artist	by	name.	There	could	be	multiple	artists	that	match	the	name

2) Once	you	have	found	the	artist	you	were	searching	for,	click	on	the	“View	Albums”	link	will	take	you	to	an	artist	detail	page	where	list of	the	albums	of	the	artist will be shown.		
3) Clicking	on	the	View	Tracks	of	an	album	listing	will	open	up	a	modal	that	shows	the	album	name,	the	release	date	and	a	list	of	tracks	in	the	album	and	the	duration	of	each	track


Application has been deployed using surge
